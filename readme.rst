Write yourself a home page with bookmarks well-organized,
browser-agnostic and easy-to-share.


Demo Site
---------

`Online Bookmarks <http://novicelive.github.io/urlmark/>`_


Installation
------------

``pip install urlmark``

Alternatively, you can simply clone and run without installation,
as long as dependencies have been installed
(e.g. ``pip install -r requirements.txt``).


Get Started
-----------

Check ``./urlmark.py --help`` and examine this repository.


Brainstorm & TODO
-----------------

- How about integrating command line interface like `cym13/bookmark`_?

- Mobile view (i.e. responsive or not)?
